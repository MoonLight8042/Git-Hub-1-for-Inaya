    <h1>What are block and non block elements</h1>
    <h3>What is a block level element?</H3>
<p>A block level element is something that always starts on a <br> new line, the browsers automatically 
    adds a margin before,<br> and after the element and it always takes 
    the most width <br>possible.</p>
</body>
<h3>What is a non-block element</h3>
<p>A non-block element is the opposite of a block element,<br> it does not 
always start on a new line plus it only takes<br> as much width as needed.
